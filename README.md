SciCo
=====

SciCo is code that helps put the science back into computer science.

Description: SciCo is the code-name (pun intended!) for this project to enable more scientific study, analysis, and discussion of code. You know how on Stackoverflow people are always asking questions, and being told they need to post an SSCCE -- that is, a Simple Self-Contained Compileable Example. Well, extending from this idea, I envision a Social Web site built around such code snippets.
